# shopping_app_exercise
This is a repository containing an exercise simulating a shopping app. 🛒

⁉️ - As I am a beginner at this, I am just trying out python exercises.
      This one simulates a store which you can acess as a store manager 
      or a customer.
      I understand that it's not done well, but I am a begginner at coding
      whatsoever, it is a totaly new thing for me!

Anyways:

📃 - main.py: This is where you run a program from
📃 - test.py: I was using this to test the functions

📁 - function_files will have scripts for running a main.py:

>>. 📃 - __init--.py: Creating a .bin file that will store items and items in cart,
          saving dicts in a .bin list, finding product ID etc.
>>. 📃 - shop.py: Separate program that simulates customer choices that will run inside main.py
>>. 📃 - store_functions.py: Functions written for managing store
>>. 📃 - shop_functions.py: Functions written for managing shop (customer's cart)

🤲 - Summary: This is a beginner's project that probably won't amaze anyone, but still
      i hope it's a big thing for me since I'm trying to tackle programming issues and
      change my career. Also, I'm uploading it here so I can practice my Git.

>>. Thanks, stay safe!
